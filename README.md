### Stage 2: Tile Types and Map Creation ✓

- Different tile types (water, grass, dirt, tree)
- Map generation with water borders
- Dirt path creation for player movement
- Enhanced CSS styling for visual tile differentiation

### Stage 3: Player Character and Basic Movement ✓

- Player character with visual representation (●)
- Arrow key movement system
- Collision detection with boundaries and obstacles
